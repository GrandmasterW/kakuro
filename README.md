# kakuro

A simple solver for Kakuro games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro), written in Clojure. 

This program only provides a terminal mode, no GUI. 

## Installation

* Install a modern JDK, for fast computation you might want to use GraalVM
* Install Clojure
* Install leiningen
* Clone repo from github
* lein run my-puzzle-file > output.html


## Usage

### Running
Basically, you can use the uberjar in target/uberjar, generated by 'lein uberjar'. Then call java like so: 

    $ java -jar kakuro-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

Args: 
* name of input file

Output:
* A HTML file containing the definition and results, you might want to redirect it into a file. 

Hint: CSS-file t.css is located in resources/. HTML file assumes it to be in same directory as itself. 

### How to construct a puzzle: 

You can construct a puzzle to be solved like the ones in the data directory. You will have to provide: 

Segments for rows and columns. Each segment needs to have: from-a to-a b sum. For a row, from-a is the smaller x value, to-a the larger x value, b is y value, for columns the other way. Sum is the constraint.
When reading the definition, the program will check if the number of cells defined by rows and by columns matches. If not, you'll be informed by an exception. 

Solutions are optional - just for testing. 

The structure is an EDN file: 
Hash-map with keys
:rows -> vector of row segments
:columns -> vector of column segments
:solutions -> vector of strings, each defining a solution. <- can be copied from html output. 

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.

## Examples

Row example: [3 5 3 12] defines a segment from x=3 to 5 (3 cells) in row 3 with sum 12
Column example: [1 3 1 9] defines a segment from y=1 to 3 (4 cells) in column 1 with sum 9

### To Do 

* Extend test cases, starting with automated solving of provided examples and comparing results
* Extend test cases
(and so on, you get it)
